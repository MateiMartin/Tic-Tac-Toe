# Tic Tac Toe

I am a student who is learning web development, particularly React and Vite. As part of my learning process, I have created this Tic Tac Toe game.

## Getting started

To run this project, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer. Once you have them installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
6. Start playing the Tic Tac Toe game!

## How to play

This Tic Tac Toe game is played on a 3x3 board. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (X or O). The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

To restart the game, simply click the "Reset" button at the end of the game.
